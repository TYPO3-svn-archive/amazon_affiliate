Link to a product
-----------------

|img-4| *Abb. 1: just a link to a product*

After successful installation of the amazon_affiliate extension, you are able to link to an amazon product with the normal linkpicker.
In order to add a new link, click the linkpicker symbol and choose the tab 'Amazon Affiliate'. After setting the ASIN you can also
add the amazon javascript hover as a mouse over effect by checking the hover checkbox. After setting the link, you'll see in the
link field a syntax like ASIN_NUMBER|1 if hover was selected, or only ASIN_NUMBER if hover was not selected.

Add as image
-----------------

|img-5| *Abb. 2: use product image as image element*

If you would like to add an amazon product as an image, you can select your favorite product using the ASIN in the Amazon ASIN
section in the 'Images' tab. After saving the content element the ASIN will be verified. If the verification fails, you see a message similar to:

|img-6|

It is also possible to use a combined rendering with amazon and normal images and multiple amazon images in columns or rows. You can add
the javascript hover as a mouse over effect by selecting the hover checkbox as in the link module. The field value is the same as in the link module.
