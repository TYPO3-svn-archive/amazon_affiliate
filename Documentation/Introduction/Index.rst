Introduction
============

This Documentation was written for version 1.0.0 of the extension.


What does it do?
----------------


Include automatically amazon product data (text and image) to your site:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The extension gives you the possibility to include amazon products in the content from your site. Either you insert an amazon
product image from a certain product with its ASIN or you get all product data through a plugin in list view. At the moment the
extension has two versions for the list view: the book view and the normal product view. The normal product view is used for the
product listing, but also for the SearchAndAdd and Topseller modules. If a product is no longer available, a scheduler task finds
the product and the problem is listed in the backend dashboard.
